            <h1>Welcome to our coffeeshop! Â¡Bienvenidos a nuestro cafe!</h1>
            <p>We are a collective of professionals, artists, professors, students, and world travellers who come together at Cafe Oliva to build friendships and enjoy a good cup of coffee. 
              Our story starts in the small coastal city of Oliva, in Valencia.</p>
              
            <p> After living in many different countries over the last ten years, we wanted to share the culture of Latin America and Spain with our friends in Albany, New York. 
              We couldn't think of a better way to share the culture of different people than by introducing their food. 
              </p>
              <p>Our coffeshop is run by professors and students inside the College of Saint Rose in Albany. All the proceeds from our sales are donated to educational non-profit organizations in Latin America and Spain.</p>
              </p> 
              <p>All the recipes we use in our bakery have been handed down to us from previous generations of bakers in our family. We only bake with fresh ingredients and we never use additives or artificial flavors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enjoy! A disfrutar!
              </p>
